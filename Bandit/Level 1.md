# Level Goal
The password for the next level is stored in a file called readme located in the home directory. Use this password to log into bandit1 using SSH. Whenever you find a password for a level, use SSH (on port 2220) to log into that level and continue the game.

# Solution
We can use the command 
```
ls
```
to list the files in our current directory. We see the readme file. We can use 
```
cat readme
```
to print the contents of the file.
