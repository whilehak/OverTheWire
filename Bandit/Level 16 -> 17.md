# Level Goal

The credentials for the next level can be retrieved by submitting the password of the current level to a port on localhost in the range 31000 to 32000. First find out which of these ports have a server listening on them. Then find out which of those speak SSL and which donâ€™t. There is only 1 server that will give the next credentials, the others will simply send back to you whatever you send to it.

## Solution
We first run a nmap scan.
```
bandit16@bandit:~$ nmap -sV localhost -p31000-32000

Looks like port 31790 is the port we're searching for. We connect to it and submit our password.
```
openssl s_client -connect localhost:31790
```
