# Level Goal
To gain access to the next level, you should use the setuid binary in the homedirectory. Execute it without arguments to find out how to use it. The password for this level can be found in the usual place (/etc/bandit_pass), after you have used the setuid binary.

## Solution
We start off by running ```ls -l```. 
```
bandit19@bandit:~$ ls -l
total 8
-rwsr-x--- 1 bandit20 bandit19 7296 May  7  2020 bandit20-do
```
We see when we execute file, we  will run it as bandit20, not bandit19. This way, we can access bandit20's password.

```
bandit19@bandit:~$ ./bandit20-do
Run a command as another user.
  Example: ./bandit20-do id
bandit19@bandit:~$ ./bandit20-do whoami
bandit20
bandit19@bandit:~$ ./bandit20-do cat /etc/bandit_pass/bandit20
